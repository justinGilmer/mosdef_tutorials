    "# MoSDeF - A Molecular Simulation Design Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "MoSDeF consists of two core Python package, [mBuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild) and [Foyer](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer), that, when combined with tools for workflow and analysis management (such as [Signac and Signac-Flow](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/signac/)) provide the means to perform complex molecular simulations in a **reproducible** manner. Reproducibility in this case is achieved by making all aspects of the simulation (system initialization, simulation execution, and analysis) scriptable, such that other researchers could execute your same scripts to achieve the same results. MoSDeF is also designed such that systems can be generated in a programmatic manner, facilitating screening of large structural/chemical parameter spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this overview, we will be focusing specifically on the tools we've developed to address the issue of **_system initialization_**, including the creation of a molecular model and the application of a force field (atom-typing and parameter assignment). The two tools contained within MoSDeF to address system initialization are:\n",

    "  \n",
    "  - [**Foyer**](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer): A package for atom-typing as well as applying and disseminating forcefields\n",
    "\n",
    "This overview is designed to introduce you to these tools in a general manner; however, more in-depth tutorials are also available from within the [mosdef_tutorials repository](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mosdef_tutorials).\n",

When a cell is executed you will first see an asterisk (i.e. [ * ]) which means that the cell is still running. When the asterisk is replaced by a number this means the execution has completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells will _not_ have numbers to the left of their cell. These are text based and not meant to be considered executable code. Executing these cells will render the Markdown cells in HTML. More information can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started)\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to connect `Compounds` we need to define locations where bonds can be formed (we can also add bonds manually through the `add_bond` method, which was covered above). mBuild handles this by allowing users to define `Ports` on particles, which essentially act as dangling bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if one had to re-write the commands for loading a CH2 molecule and adding `Ports` each time they wanted to create a molecule that included a CH2 unit, the process would be quite cumbersome. Instead, we can create a reusable class that defines our CH2 `Compound`. This approach allows one to encapsulate the routines for creating a molecular moiety into an object that can be instantiated and in a manner that can easily be shared with others.\n",
