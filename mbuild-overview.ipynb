    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "MoSDeF consists of two core Python package, [mBuild](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/mbuild) and [Foyer](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer), that, when combined with tools for workflow and analysis management (such as [Signac and Signac-Flow](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/signac/)) provide the means to perform complex molecular simulations in a **reproducible** manner. Reproducibility in this case is achieved by making all aspects of the simulation (system initialization, simulation execution, and analysis) scriptable, such that other researchers could execute your same scripts to achieve the same results. MoSDeF is also designed such that systems can be generated in a programmatic manner, facilitating screening of large structural/chemical parameter spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this overview, we will be focusing specifically on the tools we've developed to address the issue of **_system initialization_**, including the creation of a molecular model and the application of a force field (atom-typing and parameter assignment). The two tools contained within MoSDeF to address system initialization are:\n",
