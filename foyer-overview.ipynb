    "## Foyer Overview\n",
    "Foyer is designed to be a force field agnostic tool for performing atom-typing that can output to various file formats. A key aspect of Foyer is the ability to unambiguously define force field usage rules in compact format that is:\n",
    "- simultaneously human and machine readable\n",
    "- can be automatically validated\n",
    "- easy to disseminate \n",
    "- easy to evolve and expand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Format\n",
    "Foyer force fields are defined within an XML file that contains both the 'rules' required for atomtyping as well as the force field parameters within a single file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Foyer XML format is an extension of the [OpenMM forcefield XML format](http://docs.openmm.org/7.0.0/userguide/application.html#creating-force-fields). The only differences reside in the `AtomTypes` section, where several additional attributes are available (which we will examine in a moment) that allow for atomtyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AtomTypes` section of the Foyer XML is similar to that used for OpenMM forcefield XMLs; however, each `Type` in Foyer XML supports four additional attributes not found in OpenMM:\n",
    "* `def` - SMARTS string describing the chemical substructure of this atom type, as discussed later (Follow [this link](https://github.com/mosdef-hub/foyer/blob/master/docs/smarts.md) for more on SMARTS-based atomtyping using Foyer.)\n",
    "* `desc` - Brief description of the atomtype\n",
    "* `doi` - DOI reference for parameters associated with this atomtype\n",
    "* `overrides` - One or more atomtypes to 'override', providing precedence to this atomtype (discussed later)\n",

    "## Defining Chemical Context (i.e., \"Rules\") using SMARTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical force fields are typically able to achieve high accuracy by creating sets of highly specific fitting parameters (i.e., atom types), in which each atom type describes an interaction site within a different chemical context. The chemical context is typically defined by the bonded environment of an interaction site (e.g., the number of bonds and the identity of the bonded neighbors) and may also consider, among other factors, the bonded environment of the neighbors, and/or the specific molecule/structure within which the interaction site is included.  Chemical context effectively defines the 'rules' for when an atomtype should apply. \n",
    "\n",
    "Foyer relies upon using [SMARTS](http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html) to define the chemical context of an atom-type. SMARTS is a language for describing chemical structures and substructures; in Foyer we tend focus on substructures (that is, we aren't defining SMARTS as a means to define the entire molecule, but rather to uniquely differentiate each atom-type). \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider defining the chemical context of the atoms in a methane molecule ($CH_4$) using SMARTS.  The first thing to note is that there are multiple valid SMARTS that could describe the atom.  \n",
    "- For example, the simplest way to describe the carbon atom in methane would be ```[C]```.  \n",
    "- While in some cases such a simple definition may be sufficient, typically we wish to also define the number of bond, e.g., ```[C;X4]```. Note, ```;``` represents ```AND```, thus stating that the atom is a carbon with 4 bonds. \n",
    "- Often it is useful to further define the identity of those bonds. In this case, ```[C;X4](H)(H)(H)(H)```. \n",
